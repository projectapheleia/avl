AVL Constraints
===============

Although Python provides a rich library of random generators in the `random library <https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html>`_ \
and `numpy library <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html>`_, experienced verification engineers \
have grown familiar and efficient with System Verilog constraints and distributions.

AVL aims to bridge this gap, without enforcing a specific way of working, allowing the user to choose their preferred workflow.
