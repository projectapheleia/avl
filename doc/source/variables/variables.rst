AVL Variables
=============

Any python object can be used as a variable in AVL. However, AVL provides a number of variable types \
more appropriate for HDL design than the standard Python types.

Using AVL variables also allows the user to take advantage of the built-in random constraint solver.

Equally, AVL provides a simple set of variable attributes to help common use-cases.
